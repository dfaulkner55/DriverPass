# DriverPass
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  The client is Liam, the owner of DriverPass. He wanted a system that provided users with the ability to schedule appointements for on-the-road driver training and take practice tests, and also provide resources to study for driving tests.
What did you do particularly well?
  I think I did well gathering the requirements of the system.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would spend more time on my diagrams. I would make them neater and more detailed. 
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  The user's needs are important because they will be the primary people using the system. I had to think how to make the user's accessibility easy enough to not deter them away from the system. 
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
  Gathering the requirements is the most important step when designing software. I would make sure to ask as many questions as I can in order to get the best idea of what the client wants. It is also important to let the client know upfront when something they want is unrealistic.
